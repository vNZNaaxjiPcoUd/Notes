## Install OS in LUKS

How to install the UBUNTU to a LUKS system. LUKS is a lock protect file system , Just a partition of disk. Because LUKS is locked, so cannot be a boot loader. In plan, we partition to three part.

- /boot , just ext4 formate. and bind to /boot.
this is for system install bootloader,
so the install partition , need point to /boot, (/sda1) , not full disk (/sda)
- LUKS, for lock all date
    - / , partition one part of LUKS for OS, can be ext4
    - /File, partition second part of LUKS for data save, can be exfat

a disk can partiion to 3 partition , boot, system, file
/boot    1GB ext4
/        extention, luks, ext4 100GB
/File    major partition , luks, exfat other for save data

and intall to in /boot partion (/sda1) not in all disk (/sda)
